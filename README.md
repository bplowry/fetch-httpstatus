# fetch-httpstatus

I noticed some unexpected behaviour with the JavaScript `fetch` API (my issue, not theirs), so I wanted to check my assumptions. See [my blog post](https://bplowry.azurewebsites.net/2017/08/03/javascript-fetch-api/)

# How to

- `git clone https://github.com/bplowry/fetch-httpstatus.git`
- open `index.html`
- open developer console
- click the button
